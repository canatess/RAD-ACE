# 🏥 RAD-ACE: MLLMs AS RADIOLOGY ASSISTANTS

### 📌 CMP719 Computer Vision Project  
#### ✍️ Authors: **Can Ali ATEŞ, Emre ÇOBAN, Abdullah Enes ERGÜN**  

## 🧐 Overview  
**RAD-ACE** is a cutting-edge research project designed to **fine-tune vision-language large language models (VLLMs)** for **structured medical report generation**. By integrating advanced **computer vision** with **language models**, it aims to produce **accurate, coherent, and context-aware** medical analyses.  

This project focuses on enhancing the **logical structuring** of AI-generated reports, ensuring **interpretability, clinical reliability, and consistency** in diagnostic documentation.  

## 🧠 Models Used  
_(Detailed descriptions can be added later for each model.)_  
- 🔹 **Qwen 2.5 VL-3B**: Lightweight VLM used for efficient inference and baseline evaluation on vision-language tasks.  
- 🔹 **Qwen 2.5 VL-7B**: Larger variant for improved multimodal reasoning and image-text alignment. 
- 🔹 **LLaMA 3.2 Vision - 11B**: High-capacity model used for advanced multimodal understanding, including visual question answering and report generation.
